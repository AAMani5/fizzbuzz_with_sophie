## Pairing over FizzBuzz
Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming

What is Fizzbuzz?
Fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge, often described as a code kata. The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

The program can be passed a parameter - number or any other type.
When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
When passed any other number, the program simply returns the given number.
In all other cases(string, array etc), the program simply returns an error message.
